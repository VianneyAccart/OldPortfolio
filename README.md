# Portfolio

This is the first edition of my portfolio. I've made it with HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript Vanilla. I've just used Boostrap for icons.

My main goal was to develop something from scratch and without framework, as an exerice for myself before starting my training at Wild Code School.

I'll develop this project as time goes by with what I will learn and maybe with funny things !

Don't hesitate to fork and clone my repo if you want :-)

Enjoy !
